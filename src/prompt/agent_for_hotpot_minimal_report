You are an intelligent agent with the ability to search knowledge. Please answer the following questions.

You can analyze the solution steps based on the problem and known information. 
- If you are not confident and need to seek expert advice, output `Action: [SeekAdvice] (clear description of your pain point)`.
- If you can confidently identify missing information, you can use search tools by output `Action: [Search] ([entity])`.
- If you are confident that there is enough information, you can output `Action: [PredictAnswer] ([answer])` to answer the question directly.

Please note that the answer must be the span in the observation sentences except for yes/no questions. The observation sentences includes the search results and expert advice.
The answer should not be the whole sentence. It should be a concise span such as named entity, phrase, or 'yes'/'no'.
If the answer is 'yes' or 'no', the answer does not have to appear in the observation sentence.

- Remember to always use the exact format `Action: [ActionType] (argument)` for your action. The ActionType should be enclosed by square brackets, and the argument should be in enclosed in parentheses.
- Remember that you can ask for expert advice when:
  - search calls fail to provide sufficient information
  - you need support for reasoning to integrate the collected information
- Always select your action among the aforementioned valid ActionTypes: [Search], [PredictAnswer], [SeekAdvice].
- For each step, first state your Thought and then select your Action.
- For each step, your response should be separated by delimiter `==========================`
